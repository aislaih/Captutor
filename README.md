## Problem:
_**How might I design a STEAM toy to help young learners better prepared for the uncertain future of the 21st century?**_

STEM is an alternative educational approach that is being used in some schools today to better prepare student from Kindergarten-grade 12 for uncertain futures of the 21st century. However, the reality is that this approach is not very inclusive for girls and boys from diverse groups. In order for future generations to get a fair chance at having an enjoyable life in the 21st-century economy, an emphasis needs to be put on STEAM education approaches. This can be achieved by adding the arts into STEM. This includes concepts such as storytelling and maker education.

### Why this problem?
As a robotics educator, I have a passion for STEAM education. From my experience, I know students tend to enjoy this type of learning more than the type of education that is found in typical classroom settings.

## Objectives
To design a STEAM toy comprised of physical components aimed to help teach students grade 1-8 Math, Cultural Art and other subjects that can be taught at schools. The students will have the opportunity to learn by playing and doing rather than traditional learning methods.
Teachers will use the toy in different ways in the classroom to make learning more engaging and fun for the greatest number of students.
The toy will provide a STEAM Education that is inclusive to all genders and ethnicities

## Process
Conducted Expert Interviews with **teachers** at various schools
