## Problem:
_**How might I design a STEAM toy to help young learners be well-prepared for the uncertain future of the 21st century?**_

STEM is an alternative educational approach that is being used in some schools today to better prepare student from Kindergarten-grade 12 for uncertain futures of the 21st century. However, the reality is that this approach is not very inclusive for girls and boys from diverse groups. In order for future generations to get a fair chance at having an enjoyable life in the 21st-century economy, an emphasis needs to be put on STEAM education approaches. This can be achieved by adding the arts into STEM. This includes concepts such as storytelling and maker education.

* 84% of working professionals currently in science and engineering jobs in the U.S who are white or Asian males.(Wired Article) (Source: [National Science Foundation](http://www.nsf.gov/statistics/wmpd/2013/pdf/nsf13304_digest.pdf))
* 12%  drop, since 1991, in the number of computer science degrees earned by women in the U.S. (Source: [National Science Foundation](http://www.nsf.gov/statistics/wmpd/2013/pdf/nsf13304_digest.pdf))

### Why this problem?
As a robotics educator, I have a passion for STEAM education. From my experience, I know students tend to enjoy this type of learning more than the type of education that is found in typical classroom settings.

## Objectives
To design a STEAM toy comprised of physical components aimed to help teach students grade 1-8 Math, Cultural Art and other subjects that can be taught at schools. The students will have the opportunity to learn by playing and doing rather than traditional learning methods.
Teachers will use the toy in different ways in the classroom to make learning more engaging and fun for the greatest number of students.
The toy will provide a STEAM Education that is inclusive to all genders and ethnicities

## Process
Conducted Expert Interviews with **teachers** at various schools
### Key take aways:
Teachers are the ones who are going to decide if this toy will enhance their classrooms. Therefore, it is important that they fully understand how to use the tool.

#### Benefits:
* Ability to engage more students 
* Cultural awareness in the classroom
* More aware of STEAM tools and concepts in general


Conducted user tests with **students** from different ages to test out the different iterations of the toy.
### Key take aways:
Students from grades 1-8 will gain access to this teaching tool. The toy will allow students to learn by doing.

#### Benefits:
* Interactive learning
* Learning becomes more enjoyable for all genders and cultures
* Changing traditional classrooms into labs or playgrounds 
* Learning by making
* Storyboards

### First Iteration
![itteration1](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/37618137/133954949-4e157d58-dcc2-4d89-81b7-3f7f799ce45b.png)
The purpose of this prototype is to aid in the education of kids. The prototype aims to help teach kids basic 2D geometric shapes. The prototype also aims to incorporate gamification to allow more engagement and gives teachers the ability to track the progress of their students.

### Second Iteration
![itteration2](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/37618137/133953008-6f88bea8-07e0-4c06-a51a-9676d8397dc3.png)
I originally wanted to create a tool that would focus on teaching storytelling concepts through the creation of geometric shapes. Now my project focuses on only teaching storytelling by having students capturing pictures of their work in progress.

The main objective of this prototype is to be able to visually capture work in progress, from the beginning of a project to the final outcome of the project. Then Students would have a great starting point to be able to communicate through storytelling about the steps they took to complete their project.

## Solution

Cap-tutor focuses on teaching storytelling by having students capturing pictures of their work in progress from beginning to end. Using all the images collected from the device, students will be able to display their process on a webpage in an engaging manner. 

I would confirm that this is a valid and appropriate solution by conducting many usability tests with multiple grades ranging from grade 1-8. I would make sure that I would involve both the students and teachers in my test. I would make sure I would set up the right learning environments with scenarios including providing students different projects to work on. The result of these tests will be able to tell us how much value Captutor can bring to the education industry.

## Reflection
I was able to achieve a Stop Motion animation effect by displaying the images in a slider that would automatically switch every 1-2 seconds. Ideally, if I had more time and resources, I would have liked to have the slider to be an actual stop motion animation. I would have liked to be able scrub back and forth in the timeline of the stop-motion sequence/ slider of images by turning the knob on top of the teaching toy.

The final product does not have any visible bugs. However, I did want to have the ability to change the resolution of a particular image, but that part of the code was giving me lots of trouble, So I decided to have one consistent resolution that the images will be captured at.

Any feedback on this project is greatly appreciated.
